# MyPyFinances

### Why
This project was created to help me with my personal finances. I wanted to be able to plot the value of my investments over time and see how they are performing.

### Usage
To use this project, you just need to install the requirements and run the Main.py file. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python Main.py
```

If you don't have a file called "stocks.txt" the program will ask you for the tickers and quantities you want to add.
