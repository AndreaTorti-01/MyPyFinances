# MyPyFinances

### Why
This project was created to help me with my personal finances. I wanted to be able to plot the value of my investments over time and see how they are performing.

### Usage
To use this project, you just need to download the .exe file in the releases section.

Alternatively, you may download the source, install the requirements with pip and run the Main.py file. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv env
pip install -r requirements.txt
python Main.py
```

If you don't have a file called "stocks.txt" the program will ask you for the tickers and quantities you want to add.
